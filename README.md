## Notes
Some of the plugins in this repository may not be compatible with your PocketMine installation. Most of the time it is because of API changes, and commonly users make API bumps, which is not recommended and will not guarantee their partial or total support. Most likely we as contributors have to make changes to the code that involve the loss of features exceptionally. 

Please submit an issue if you have problems running plugins.
